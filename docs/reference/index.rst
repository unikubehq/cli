All Unikube CLI commands are organized into different groups, such as :ref:`unikube auth<unikube_auth>`, :ref:`unikube system<unikube_system>` or :ref:`unikube project<unikube_project>`. 
However, there are additional shortcuts for frequently used commands, which are directly accessible under :ref:`unikube<unikube_shortcut>`, such as :code:`unikube login`. 
In the following, commands with shortcuts are described first as they cover the main workflow with the Unikube CLI. 
Detailed information about shortcuts can be found in the corresponding group sections.
